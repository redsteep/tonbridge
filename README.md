ETH to TON relayed bridging

## FunC contracts designed for bridging ETH to TON network. 

Current functionalities implelented:
- Merkle proof verification (FunC);
- BLS-signature verifications (FunC);

These are the part of the upcoming bridge project we are to build alongside with relayer node. Here we need merkles to verify transaction-on-chain and BLS to get ETH-validators signatures verified.
